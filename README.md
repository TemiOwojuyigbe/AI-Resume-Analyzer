AI Resume Analyzer

An AI-powered tool that extracts text from resumes and analyzes them against job descriptions to provide targeted improvements.
Why I Built This?

In today's hyper-competitive job market, many applications are automatically rejected before a human even sees them. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) scan resumes for keywords, skills, and formatting—if they don’t match the job description, they get tossed.

This project was built to help job seekers improve their resumes so they have a better chance of getting past automated filters and reaching hiring managers.

I felt this was an important tool because:

    Many qualified applicants are rejected simply because their resume lacks the right keywords.
    Job descriptions are often complex and vague, making it hard for applicants to tailor their resumes effectively.
    AI can level the playing field by identifying missing skills and optimizing resumes for better results.

With this tool, users can: Upload their resume (PDF or DOCX)
Get AI-powered feedback on how to improve it
See missing keywords and relevant suggestions based on the job description
